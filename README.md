# VISU - PHP Game Framework

A Modern OpenGL Framework for PHP, ex php-game-framework. VISU aims to be a simple, yet powerful framework for creating 2D and 3D games and applications.
It comes with high level abstractions for common tasks but also allows you to access the underlying OpenGL API directly. Additionally, VISU provides an optional framework structure to quickly bootstrap a new application.

**Visu is built on top of [PHP-GLFW](https://phpgl.net) so make sure the extension is installed and enabled.**
